Display will now read bn 160 for 160m, bn 6 for 6m, bn 4 for 4m, bn 1.2 for 1.2m, bn .70 for 70cm for ham bands

WWV stations begin with bn 2.5 for 2.5MHz, bn 5 for 5MHz, bn 10 for 10MHz and bn 15 for 15MHz. More information here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_(radio_station)

CHU station will read bn3.33 for 3.33MHz. More information here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHU_(radio_station)

!!! WARNING !!!  4m band is not available in the USA and many other countries, it was included for our friends across the pond. More information here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-meter_band

You are responsible for everything that goes wrong, including my bad code! Kind of like being married. HI
